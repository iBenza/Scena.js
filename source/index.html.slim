    p
      | Scena.js is an HTML based presentation framework.
        It's powered by HTML5 and CSS transitions. You will install
        the browser which supports such techniques.
    p
      | This is inspired by similar frameworks such as 
      a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" Reveal.js
      |  and 
      a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/#now-what" Deck.js
      | , however, Scena.js is not for beauty's sake.  It can be used in
        everything situations from formal to casual, by designing theme.
